# Fire Movement Animation

Palisades and Eaton fires of 7 January 2025 have traumatized many people and burnt down many properties. Areas affected by such fires are generally barricaded by the Fire Department, and people displaced from there cannot visit their properties. Many of these people desire to monitor movement of fires around their properties.

In view of this necessity, this repository presents an Excel macro file and an interactive web page for animating movement of fires around a location. This may need the location's latitude and longitude, which can be obtained using maps . google . com or such other website. This version uses NASA EarthData data of USA for the period 1 to 11 January 2025.
